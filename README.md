# CS253-Analysis-of-Programming-Languages
This repo includes my homework and notes based on the UCI-CS253 Analysis of Programming Language, taught by Professor Christina Lopes.

The general purpose of this course is to learn different kinds of programming styles. In order to have some hands on experience, the course has some homework which require us to write codes to extract the top 25 frequency words except for some stop words.

The book has included 33 programming styles. During the quarter. I realized 18 of them with a language other than python, which is the language used to illustrate the coding style in the book. The course also includes some after-class reading materials about how these programming styles are developed over time. Every week we have a reading material and I wrote a summary for it with some of my own thoughts. I got deeper understandings of different programming ways like functional programming, concurrent programming, etc.
